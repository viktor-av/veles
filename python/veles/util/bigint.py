    Encodes an arbitrarily-sized integer to bytes in a way that preserves
    ordering - ``bigint_encode(a) < bigint_encode(b)`` iff ``a < b``.

    The exact encoding is as follows:

    - first 4 bytes of the encoded value is a big endian number called the
      header.  It represents the number's size (in bytes) and sign.  Positive
      numbers have ``0x80000000 + size`` as the header, while negative numbers
      are have ``0x80000000 - size``.
    - the rest of the encoding represents the number itself, encoded as big
      endian of ``size`` bytes.  If the number is positive, it is stored
      directly.  If it is negative, its absolute value is stored with all bits
      inverted.
    - the number is always stored with the smallest size that will fit it -
      in particular, 0 is stored with a header of 0x80000000 and no payload.
